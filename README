EasyOpts simplify the options management to other plugins through some facilities:
 - allow the plugin to initialize all the user-exposed variables to a predefined value (if not already specified).
 - allow the user to change the option values through a simple menu
 - check if the values specified by the user are correct

Full documentation about how to use the plugin is provided in the help file and is demoed through some examples
