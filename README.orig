--- easyopts ---
Easyopts is a plugin for Vim which could be used to write other plugins.

This plugin comes with the ideas of simplify the options management when
writing others plugins. Therefore, unless you are writing a plugin, you won't
need this plugin.

The aim of this plugin is to ensure that all requested variables are setted with
correct values and to provide an easy menu for following changes.

-- Examples --
In the examples folder is available one example.
To try it do as follow:
    1. Load the plugin
    2. Source the example file
        :source <example-file>
    3. Initialize all the variables
        :call EasyOpts_Init( g:uservars )
    4. Open the menu:
	:call EasyOpts_Menu_Open( "Test", g:uservars )

Now you have the options menu open. To close it use :bd.
Don't forget to try the autocompletion function for the Zodiac
